in the usb implementation, we use a protocol called CDC-ACM
to emulate a serial port over USB.

Linux has a driver that then recognizes our device as a tty
and assigns it the device file /dev/ttyACMx, but this tty
by default has a setting that echoes back everything our 
device writes to the host. This causes us to enter an infinite
read loop. To avoid this, run this command

stty --file=/dev/ttyACMx -echo

this needs to be run every time the USB connection is reset,
hard or soft.
