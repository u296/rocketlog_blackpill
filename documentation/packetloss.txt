There seems to be some packet loss over the usb protocol, and the 
readings sent along are sometimes garbage. At first i thought this
was an issue with the usb implementation, since the library's values
don't seem to align with the reference manual.

However, when testing I reseated the wires to the accelerometer and
found out that the error rate suddenly changed drastically for all
EP counts in the library, suggesting that this is an electrical issue,
something might be interfering with the usb connection. Maybe using an
external powersupply for the board would help?
